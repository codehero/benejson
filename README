NOTES

Version 0.9.5 Known Bugs/TODO:

1) benejson currently does not translate escape characters in map keys to UTF-8.
As an example, benejson would interpret {"key\n":0} as a key with 4 characters; it would NOT convert '\n' to a single char.
Obviously this is broken behaviour according the JSON spec, but I will only fix it if somebody really needs it...
2) Similarly, benejson only optimizes its key search for strings in UTF-8.
UTF-16/32 strings should be converted to UTF-8 and lexicographically sorted to use this functionality.
3) jsonoise generates a limited subset of strings (only UTF-8, no escapes)
4) jsonoise should also generate JSON with a single error
5) benejson.js is in alpha and at the moment does not strictly check syntax
